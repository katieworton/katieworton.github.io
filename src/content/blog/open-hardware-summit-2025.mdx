On 30th and 31st May the [Open Hardware Summit](https://2025.oshwa.org/) took place in Edinburgh's [award winning Nucleus building](https://www.ribaj.com/buildings/riba-awards-2025-rias-scotland-nucleus-building-university-of-edinburgh-sheppard-robson-education).

All the talks and workshops were recorded and are available to watch on [The Open Source Hardware Association's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@OpenSourceHardware/videos).

In this post we'll take a quick tour through some of the highlights and takeaways from the event.

## Highlights

### All Yarns Are Beautiful: Breathing new life into old knitting machines

From the Ancient Egyptians to late-20th-Century punch card knitting machines, Carson Holgate takes us through the history of knitting machines. She highlights the efforts to breathe new life into hardware which would otherwise be left of the shelf.

The open source hardware and software communities have come together with the knitting community to create custom PCB designs and software, allowing knitting machine owners to replace the outdated electronics of their 1980s knitting machines with newer, better hardware and software.

This is a must-watch for hardware repairability advocates and knitting enthusiast alike*.

<sup><sup>*Carson's amazing machine-knitted QR code dress is also a must-see.</sup></sup>

### The Mothbox Project: How Open Source Hardware Can Benefit Conservation Research

Andy Quitmeyer talks through the fascinating work of the Mothbox Project, creating ["a low-cost, high-performance insect monitor"](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/) featuring a ["power efficient and lightweight design that helps field biologists deploy it in the depths of the jungle"](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/).

Andy explains how the hyperdiverse and highly localised properties of bugs make them an excellent source of data for measuring ecosystem health, and explores the unique challenges associated with designing and deploying such hardware in the extreme conditions of a jungle.

### Maintaining KiCad's libraries

In this talk, Kliment discusses the challenges in maintaining the KiCad project and progress that has been made to address these issues. Challenges addressed include the never-ending nature of incoming pull requests and lack of code reviewers.

This talk gives an interesting insight into both managing the maintenance of a large open source project and techniques to help prevent maintainer burnout in such projects.

### Disability & Open Source Hardware

The Disability & Open Source Hardware panel provides a challenging but important insight into the way tech and disability interface.

From Eilidh Troup's "Mr Flashy Bleepy" project used to treat her stroke-related vision loss, to Lorraine Underwood's single-handed keyboard, to Phoenix Perry's groundbreaking approaches to disability-inclusive design; this panel offers eye-opening insights into the power tech has to help those with disabilities, why this is important and how we can do better.

## Final comments and links

This has just been a brief overview of my top highlights from the Open Hardware Summit 2025.

Some other amazing talks and panels included:
- [The building a FAIR Battery talk](https://youtu.be/6ikWCuvi0Gs) - a project aiming to produce an open-source battery
- [The Wearable Techniques panel](https://youtu.be/8lUfydwfz14) - offers insights into the interdisciplinary field of open-source wearable tech
- [The Open Source Medical panel](https://youtu.be/EhBkTFVUy5o) - highlights the benefits and challenges of open-sourcing medical devices

And many more! I would highly recommend you to look through The Open Source Hardware Association's [YouTube playlist for the event](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN2I5IwhHQ4qhEqAuk_MD0JZDzbTyWRXd).
