I am currently undertaking an MSc in High Performance Computing with Data Science at The University of Edinburgh.

For my dissertation project, I am training machine learning models to identify images of Scottish prehistoric rock art, working with a dataset provided by [Historic Environment Scotland](https://rockart.scot/).
